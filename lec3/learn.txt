# What is a smart pointer?
A C++ class that acts as a wrapper around a raw pointer and provides automtic memory management. It ensures
that the dynamically allocated memory is properly deallocated when it's no longer needed helping to proverent 
memory leaks

# What is a memory leak
A memory leak occurs when a  program allocates memory dynamically usually on the heap but fails to release or 
deallocate that memory  properly before the program terminates. As a result, the memory becomes in accessible
and is effectively lost, leading to a gradual decreasein available memory over time.

# What is a Shared pointer?
A shared pointers keep track of the number of shared pointers pointing to the same object using a reference 
count mechanism. When  a shared pointer is created, the reference count is incremented. When a shared pointer
goes out of scope or is explicitly reset, the reference count is decremented. When the reference count drops
to zero, the object's memory is deallocated.
