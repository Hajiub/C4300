Program Specification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment you will be writing a c++/SFML program which will read descriptions of shape from a 
configuration file, and then drawing those shapes to the screen. Each shape will have a name, position, 
speed , color, as well as properties unique to each shape type.

You are also required to make these shapes "bounce" off the sides of the window which contains them. this
means that if the shape's left side hists the left side of the window, it's x Speed reverses. if the top
of the shape hists the top of the window, it's Y speed reverses. Similiarly, if it hits the right side or 
bottom of the window. You can assume that all shapes will always be configured to start entirely within
the window, and  you don't  have to worry about what happens if they start outside the window. Each 
shapes's name should be drawn on the exact center of the shape in the given font size and color specified 
in the file.
